They help identify abnormalities such as tumors, inflammation, stroke, multiple sclerosis plaques, and degenerative diseases among others.

The cerebral cortex: This outer layer with its characteristic folds or gyri looks like it has normal sulcation.\n2. White matter: It's seen as lighter areas between the darker grey matter on both sides of the brain which consists mainly of myelinated axons that connect different parts of gray matter together.\n3.

Basal ganglia: A group of nuclei located deep within the white matter beneath the internal capsule, involved in motor control among other functions.\n5.
